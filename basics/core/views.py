# django has a 3 base class views
# 1) the class 'view' is the base class
# All other class-based views inherit from this base class. 
# It isnâ€™t strictly a generic view and thus can also be imported from django.views.
# as class view example:
class Main(View):
    # here we define a get method
    # when this class is called as view with get method from HTTP
    # this fuction is called
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return HttpResponse('Main')

# 2) the class TemplateView
# Renders a given template, with the context containing parameters captured in the URL.
# that class renders a HTML template, with information requested
class HomePageView(TemplateView):
    # and our template is passed as
    template_name = "home.html"

        # here, context will be all data requested from some model
        # context['latest_articles'] = Article.objects.all()[:5]
        return context

# 3) the class RedirectView
# this class redirect to a especific given url
# when called is redirect to a url passed in path (route describe)
